Project Overview
GaBasa is a Windows desktop–based Library Management System developed using C# .NET WinForms, designed specifically for the UMTC Visayan Campus Library. This system aims to automate and streamline library operations, including cataloging, member management, circulation of books, fine calculation, and reporting.
Traditional library management relies heavily on manual processes, which are often time-consuming and prone to errors. GaBasa addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly platform that improves workflow, ensures accurate record-keeping, and enhances the overall library experience for librarians, staff, and members.
The system also incorporates role-based access control, allowing different types of users — Librarians, Library Staff, and Members — to access only the modules relevant to their responsibilities. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles, clean software architecture, and modern Windows desktop technology, GaBasa provides a practical and robust solution for managing library resources effectively.
